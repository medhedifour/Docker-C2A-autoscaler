# Docker-C2A-autoscaler


Docker-C2A is a cost-aware autoscaler for microservices-based applications deployed with docker containers. 
This autoscaler decreases the cost of the application deployment as reduces the computing resources. 

Docker-C2A identifies the adequate microservices to add resources and calculates the optimal number of needed containers.
In fact, this autoscaler analyses the state of the application, uses the execution history and uses
a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. 
The PSO algorithm is used to identify the adequate microservices for scaling resources and to determine the optimal number of containers.
